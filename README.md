# AI-Fire-Detection-System
Using deep learning and image processing techniques to detect fire in images as a supplementary tool to traditional fire detection systems
AI-Based Fire Detection System
This repository contains code for a deep learning project aimed at detecting fire in images. The system can be used as a supplementary tool to enhance traditional fire detection systems.

The project uses Python, Keras, TensorFlow, and OpenCV to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on a dataset of images categorized into two classes - fire and no-fire.

The repository is organized as follows:

train.py - This script prepares the image data, builds and trains the model, and saves the trained model.
predict.py - This script loads the trained model and uses it to predict whether a given image contains fire or not.
